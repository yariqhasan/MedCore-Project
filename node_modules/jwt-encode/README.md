# jwt-encode

> Generate json webtokens in the browser

## Purpose
Sometimes you need to create a Json Webtoken (JWT) in the browser. This is very tiny module that enables this but only for the `HS256` algorithm and the `JWT` type.

## Usage

```js
const sign = require('jwt-encode');
const secret = 'secret';
const data = {
  sub: '1234567890',
  name: 'John Doe',
  iat: 1516239022
};
const jwt = sign(data, secret);
console.log(jwt);
//'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.XbPfbIHMI6arZ3Y922BhjWgQzWXcXNrz0ogtVhfEd2o'
```
